## From now on, the GitHub repository address of HUAWEI ML Kit Demo is changed to https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-ml-demo. Then, code in the old repository will not be maintained or updated. We will update our features of HUAWEI ML Kit, such as, automatic speech recognition(ASR) and audio file transcription(TTS), in the new repository. Welcome to use HUAWEI ML Kit.


## Introduction

This project contains examples of using the machine learning APIs provided by Huawei mlkit
and applications developed based on the machine learning service SDK. The project directory is as follows:

1. [MLKit-Sample](https://github.com/HMS-MLKit/HUAWEI-HMS-MLKit-Sample/tree/master/MLKit-Sample): The sample code mainly shows the use of Huawei Machine Learning SDK.
2. [ID-Photo-DIY](https://github.com/HMS-MLKit/HUAWEI-HMS-MLKit-Sample/tree/master/ID-Photo-DIY): It uses still image of people to composite an ID photo with blue background or white background.
3. [Smile-Camera](https://github.com/HMS-MLKit/HUAWEI-HMS-MLKit-Sample/tree/master/Smile-Camera): It uses real-time detection of face to confirm if user is smiling, and then captures a smile photo of the user.
4. [Photo-Translate](https://github.com/HMS-MLKit/HUAWEI-HMS-MLKit-Sample/tree/master/Photo-Translate): It uses still image of text to translate words in the photo into the language you want.

## Precautions

This project contains multiple independent projects. After downloading the code,
you can open a certain project individually in Android Studio for compilation,
or you can add multiple apps to the same project. There's no need to create separate projects for each app.
You can open setting.gradle to select the project you need to compile.
